\section{Title 0 : Neuroplasticity and Cognitive Development: How the Brain Adapts and Changes}
Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. It adapts to new experiences and learning. Exercise can enhance neuroplasticity and brain function.\subsection{Neuroplasticity: How Experience Changes the Brain - Verywell Mind}
Neuroplasticity: How Experience Changes the Brain Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt due to experience. Some research indicates that exercise might help prevent neuron loss in key areas of the hippocampus,12 a part of the brain involved in memory and other functions.Other studies suggest that exercise plays a role in new neuron formation in this same region.13 Without neuroplasticity, it would be difficult to learn or otherwise improve brain function.

It means that the brain is not fixed but has the potential to adapt, repair, and compensate for damage or dysfunction.\subsection{Neuroplasticity: How the brain changes with learning}
Image 3: Neuroplasticity: How the brain changes with learning The IBRO/IBE-UNESCO Science of Learning Fellowship aims to support and translate key neuroscience research on learning and the brain to educators, policy makers, and governments. The connections between neurons, through the synapses, however, are constantly changing throughout all of our life and are predominantly responsible for learning and memory in the brain. In this way, much learning in the brain involves changing the connections between neurons, particularly reinforcing those pathways or circuits of interconnected neurons that are used frequently and fire together. Nonetheless, these basic principles of neurons and synapses, changing and strengthening connections, are at the root of all learning in the brain.\subsection{The power of neuroplasticity: How your brain adapts and grows as ...}

It is defined as the ability of the nervous system to change its activity in response to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli by reorganizing its structure, functions, or connections after injuries, such as a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI). These include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like fluoxetine, serotonin and noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) like duloxetine, cholinergic agonists such as donepezil, glutaminergic partial antagonists like amantadine, and several others.Amantadine has been shown to improve recovery in patients in a minimally conscious or vegetative state after a severe TBI.Amantadine has also been shown to have an increase in left prefrontal cortex activation in association with improved cognitive functioning in patients with chronic TBI.As research continues, we will be able to utilize pharmacological treatments further to help guide the brain back to health.

For the most benefit, adults need at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity weekly or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity. Here are ways to be more physically active: Find more tips to fit physical activity into your day with Move Your Way. Health care providers play an important role in helping patients become more physically active to improve their health. **Educate patients** about the connection between physical activity and physical and mental health. Adults who are not able to meet the physical activity guidelines need to do whatever regular physical activity they can. Connect patients to physical activity resources.
